## General

* [Github Awesome](https://github.com/windmaple/awesome-AutoML)


## Feature Engineering

* [Feature Engine](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engines)

Feature-engine is a Python library with multiple transformers to engineer and select features for use in machine learning models. Feature-engine's transformers follow Scikit-learn's functionality with fit() and transform() methods to learn the transforming parameters from the data and then transform it.


## Model Selection

* [AutoML](https://github.com/google/automl)


## Performance 

* https://github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks

Deepchecks is a Python package for comprehensively validating your machine learning models and data with minimal effort. This includes checks related to various types of issues, such as model performance, data integrity, distribution mismatches, and more.
