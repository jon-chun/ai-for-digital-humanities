# About the Computational Digital Humanities Colaboratory (cDH Colab)

## **Jon Chun**

Jon Chun has degrees in computer science and cognitive science from UC Berkeley and UT Austin.

He has co-founded several startups including the world’s largest anonymity service backed by large Wall Street hedge funds and the CIA’s venture fund In-Q-Tel. His specialization in cross-cultural experiences of technology stems from working and studying throughout the US, Asia and Latin America. Before arriving in Gambier he was a Director for one of the worlds largest security corporations in Silicon Valley and Entrepreneur in Residence at UC Berkeley. He speaks English, Spanish and Japanese.

As an American Heart Research Fellow, he conducted and published research in both gene therapy and medical informatics.  He has also worked for the Advanced Light Source Group at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the semiconductor research consortium SEMATECH.  His research interests include machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics, data visualizations and statistical modeling. His most recent research is on NLP in sentiment analysis and generative narrative.

He is interested in bringing diverse voices to urgent debates surrounding technology’s growing impact on society. His courses, Programming Humanity and AI for the Humanities, seek to bridge the gap between technology and the Humanities by designing an intellectual framework grounded in the liberal arts and computational thinking.
