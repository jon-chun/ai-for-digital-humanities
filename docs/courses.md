# Curriculum: AI for Computational Digital Humanites

## **[Integrated Program for Humane Studies](https://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-and-majors/integrated-program-in-humane-studies/)**

As a student in Kenyon’s oldest interdisciplinary program, you will explore how different cultures have answered life’s fundamental questions. What makes a good life? How do we live in a community? Why do we have art? What defines our humanity? You will consider these questions from multiple perspectives, studying with faculty from across the curriculum.

Explore human ideas, creations and inventions that have defined our present.

Classes in the Integrated Program in Humane Studies are for those who won’t settle for either/or and who are not content with a single perspective. The program’s first-year course explores human ideas, creations and inventions that have defined our present, from the origins of poetry and philosophy to the foundations of computer science.

Focus on real-world challenges.

Later courses dive more deeply into our present and even our future. Can we program our humanity into our inventions or will we be shaped irrevocably by our tools? Can AI know us better than ourselves and offer a mirror onto our very nature? By the end of the concentration, students will have a digital portfolio of hands-on projects that focus on real-world challenges. Concentrators have the opportunity to join the KDH lab and be part of a collaborative multi-disciplinary team engaged in cutting-edge research. 

## **[Digital Humanities](https://www.kenyon.edu/digital-humanities/)**

Digital humanities at Kenyon encompasses a dual lens. We empower the next generation of thinkers with the conceptual framework underlying our Age of Information — from dataism and algorithmic thinking to synthetic biology and artificial intelligence. Our unique approach to computational thinking positions students to engage with the many practical, theoretical and ethical issues surrounding technological innovation and social change.

Digital humanities also explores the most recent computational approaches as a way to augment — rather than replace — more traditional humanist inquiry. Students imagine and pursue new avenues of research by identifying unexplored datasets of text, image and sound, while embracing new computational frameworks that are increasingly powerful and easy to use. We focus on finding interdisciplinary solutions to today's challenges.

Students interested in digital humanities are encouraged to start with our introductory course, "Programming Humanity." Advanced courses include "A.I. for the Humanities." All digital humanities courses are project-based, and students will have a portfolio of innovative projects by the end of their course of study.

## **Courses**
### [IPHS200 Programming Humanity](https://programminghumanity.wordpress.com/)

Artificial intelligence is poised to surpass humans in intellectual abilities that we often associate with being human. What are the implications for how we think about digital humanities? Can we program humanity by employing AI to generate music, analyze vast quantities of literary text, or produce great visual works of art? Or will humans be programmed through predictive policing, manipulations of social media, and domestic surveillance? Can the non-profit OpenAI build an AI to benefit humanity, or will the prophecies of Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk (who all claim AI as the greatest existential threat to humanity) come true?

This course will bridge the gap between humanities and technology in both a theoretical and practical manner. Each week we will present a fundamental technology like data visualization, social media hacking or machine learning through both lecture and hands-on labs. In parallel, we will contextualize our understanding of new technologies with discussions of the larger social impact and ethical dilemmas through case studies like computational literary analysis, digital profiling for predictive policing or issues stemming from potential broad structural economic unemployment. The broader goal of the course is to understand technologies driving seismic social change in order to be able to speak with an informed voice.

This is an introductory survey course with no prerequisites. It is designed for both humanities students seeking to understand technology and technology-oriented students seeking to understand the larger social and ethical issues surrounding technology.

### [IPHS300 AI for the Humanities](https://aiforthehumanities.wordpress.com/)

"Why isn’t AI a branch of mathematics?" Norvig and Russell ask in their seminal textbook "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach." "The first answer," they explain, "is that AI from the start embraced the idea of duplicating human faculties such as creativity, self-improvement, and language use"(18).

We explore AI from this humanist perspective by building a foundation to understand the creativity, self-improvement and language at the core of the discipline. Our approach blends the conceptual with hands-on exploration and application. We think through the humanist-centered theory and practice of artificial intelligence and machine learning from a liberal arts perspective that is highly interdisciplinary in nature. To that end, the course will touch on domains intertwined with AI like cognitive science and language and linguistics.

Textual analysis will receive our major attention and will provide an ideal foundation for literature students interested in computational approaches to literature. However we will also explore a wide range of textual applications that will be of interest to a broader range of students: textual analytics that help us explore disciplines like economics, politics, sociology, cultural studies and psychology. The last weeks of the course will move to image and sound by building on previous skills acquired from textual analysis.

### [IPHS220 Cultural Analytics](https://jon-chun.github.io/cultural-analytics/)

Cultural analytics is the study of society and social phenomena by analyzing data and the way it flows. This course presumes some coding experience or the introductory course to Digital Humanities, Programming Humanity. We start my visualizing geospatial data via maps and charts. We’ll build on our skills using API’s to create original datasets from social media sites like Twitter. Then we’ll develop natural language processing skills including sentiment analysis and topic clustering to explore text for insights. We’ll also learn how to graph and explore social networks. In class, we’ll do some hands-on projects like analyzing the social network of Game of Thrones and trying to classify who’s tweeting: Trump or Trudeau. In the final segment of the course, students develop their own project centered on their interests.
